1. booking types should be selection not string
2. pagination
3. title in different pages
4. datetime present and edit issue, as well as the timezone issue
5. have a setting area, allows barber shop set up the opening hours and timezone
6. booking cancel button need a confirmation modal
7. booking date and booking time does not show constraint, which is because the input of two fields rely on
the date input and choice input. It might be able to be changed through js, which I will look into that next.
