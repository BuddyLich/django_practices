## Back-End

1. booking types should be selection not string
2. datetime present and edit issue, as well as the timezone issue
3. booking date and booking time does not show constraint, because the input of two fields rely on
the date input and choice input. It might be able to be changed through js, which I will look into that next.
4. add a different user page for admin/barber
5. user password reset, authentication and confirmation
6. limit the number that user can make booking at the same time
7. make a customer list view

## Front-End
1. using js to disable the unavailable booking date/time
