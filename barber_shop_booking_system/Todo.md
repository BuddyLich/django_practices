## Back-End

1. booking types should be selection not string
2. pagination
3. title in different pages
4. datetime present and edit issue, as well as the timezone issue
5. have a setting area, allows barber shop set up the opening hours and timezone
6. booking cancel button need a confirmation modal
7. booking date and booking time does not show constraint, because the input of two fields rely on
the date input and choice input. It might be able to be changed through js, which I will look into that next.
8. use email not username in the login page
11. add a different user page for admin/barber
12. add an email response when booking is confirmed
13. user password reset, authentication and confirmation
14. limit the number that user can make booking at the same time


## Front-End
1. using js to disable the unavailable booking date/time
2. better page UI
