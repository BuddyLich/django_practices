## Back-End

1. booking types should be selection not string
2. title in different pages
3. datetime present and edit issue, as well as the timezone issue
4. have a setting area, allows barber shop set up the opening hours and timezone
5. booking cancel button need a confirmation modal
6. booking date and booking time does not show constraint, because the input of two fields rely on
the date input and choice input. It might be able to be changed through js, which I will look into that next.
7. add a different user page for admin/barber
8. add an email response when booking is confirmed
9. user password reset, authentication and confirmation
10. limit the number that user can make booking at the same time
11. add user profile and its link to the backstage_booking page
12. add booking information to user profile
13. make a customer list view

## Front-End
1. using js to disable the unavailable booking date/time
2. better page UI
